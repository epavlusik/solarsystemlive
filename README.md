## Description :clipboard:

I was always fascinated by the beauty and balance of our Solar System.
I gave myself challenge to create the model of the solarsystem using only CSS.

## My goals were:

1. Show the planets in context of their actual speed comparing to the others
2. Indicate the size of planets (just approximated)

## Challenges:

1. It would be interesting to use some API that would bring the information about the current position of planets.
2. Making the Planets clickable revealing some basic information about them would be interesting.
